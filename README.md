## Submission for Web 110

My goal with this project was to create an app that helped a team of developers and non-developers keep track of all the products they were tasked with modernizing and maintaining. I also wanted to have a public facing record that showed how many project were already underway. 

### Backend

The backend server user node.js express with jsonwebtoken for JWT authentication and authorization and Mongoose for interacting with a database on MongoDB Atlas.
